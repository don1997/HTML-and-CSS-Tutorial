<!-- This is my first HTML/CSS Project it is based off of the project from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n64hIV3F4A&t=200s
I made some of my own adjustments to it because I am just playing around right now with HTML and CSS. See bottom for change notes and lessons learned-->

            <pre>
            After all the jacks are in their boxes
            And the clowns have all gone to bed
            You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
            Footprints dressed in red
            And the wind whispers, "Mary"
            A broom is drearily sweeping
            Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
            Somewhere, a queen is weeping
            Somewhere, a king has no wife
            And the wind, it cries, "Mary"
            The traffic lights, they turn blue tomorrow
            And shine their emptiness down on my bed
            The tiny island sags downstream
            'Cause the life that lived is dead
            And the wind screams, "Mary"
            Will the wind ever remember
            The names it has blown in the past?
            And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
            It whispers, "No, this will be the last"
            And the wind cries, "Mary"
                </pre>

<!-- Change note 0: Started Initial Project. Learned the 'Pre' tag. It alows the text to flow more like a poem or 
    lyrics paragraph. Also learned alot about classes, containers ids, selectors, align-text, floats and flexbox today!-->
